# What is this?

_L'Italia s'è desta_ is a mod for [Hearts of Iron IV](https://store.steampowered.com/app/394360/Hearts_of_Iron_IV/), the World War II themed grand strategy game by Paradox.

## Name and history

This mod is a fork of [Fratelli d'Italia](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1918279813), made by the awesome `fab88de`.

Unfortunately the original author seems to have taken an extended break, and since his work was so amazing, I decided to pick it up and continue it.

The name of the mod is the natural continuation, following the opening of the Italian anthem:

```
Fratelli d'Italia,
l'Italia s'è desta,
dell'elmo di Scipio,
s'è cinta la testa.
```

## Goals and development

The mod as picked up by me had a lot of design and gruntwork done but was lacking in aesthetics and refinement. For this reason polishing of focuses, events and graphics was the first thing I worked on.

I will be fixind and expanding the fascist focus tree up to satisfaction and then revamp the monarchic and communist trees.
