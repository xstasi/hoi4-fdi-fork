 news.524.desc:0"The board presented a detailed analysis, and a plan for eradication. The biggest obstacle is the civilians, who trust the mob more than the state and perceive them as more legitimate.\n\nThe plan can be summarised with the following steps:\n1) We start a phony mafia family, backed with army resources, to challenge the existing authority.\n2) The people's trust is diverted to our "family".\n3) We effectively control organised crime.\n\nCesare Mori - part of the committee - has vocally expressed his dissent with these mostly non-violent measures, calling them an affront to his work."

The soldiers apprehended the gangsters before they could make their escape, executed them and left them on display.\n\nRumours are now circulating that the new player has managed to infiltrate the army.

The monarchic party is worried for the stability of the government, fearing Italy might be another populist away from total disaster. Away from public scrutiny Vittorio Emanuale is being loudly criticised in the parliament. The party is asking the king do abdicate and to allow another Savoia, with better public support, to lead the country."
